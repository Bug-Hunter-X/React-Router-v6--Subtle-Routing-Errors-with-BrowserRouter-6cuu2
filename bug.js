```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ...other routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code uses `BrowserRouter`, which is correct for client-side routing, but might cause issues if nested within another router or if you're attempting server-side rendering (SSR) with a different router.  The error might manifest as unexpected behavior or routing not working as expected.  It might not produce an obvious error message, making it hard to debug.  If you are attempting to nest routers, you should use different router types or resolve the conflict.
